As of the morning of 7/01

Things that Work:
- finished Show Balance and Print Statement butons
- clear button works (although it may not be the most efficient method)
- exit button works

Main Problems 
- displaying exception pop-ups for withdrawls (I can't get them to actually pop up or alert the user that they are doing something wrong ... but I know that the BankAccount withdrawl method works because if you try to withdraw too much and then "Print Statement", it displays overdrafts/fees. The alerts from the exceptions aren't working for me)
